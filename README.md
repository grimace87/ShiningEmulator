## Shining Emulator

Emulates a game boy system. Projects included for Windows and Android.

Does not include any games, and never will include any games that aren't made freely available by the developer.

## Building

- Windows project is in the ShiningEmulatorWindows folder; tested using CLion. Open the project in that folder. Requires the MSVC toolchain installed (install Visual Studio with C++ Desktop development components).
- Android project is in the ShiningEmulatorAndroid folder; tested using Android Studio. Import the project in that folder, and it should be as simple as running the project from there.
