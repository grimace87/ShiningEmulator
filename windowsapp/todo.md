
### Windows

- CPU usage is flat out

### Android

- Save files seem to disappear unexpectedly sometimes

### General

- Window state saved across runs often loads into softlocked state
- Frames shown out of order when running at high speed
- Audio with duty cycle could possibly have bias set to offset non-zero average
- Speed multiplier should be shown on-screen once adjusted

#### From Donkey Kong Land 2

- Sprites are visible within window (stand on barrels in first level, confirmed this is an error)
- Graphics are corrupted by loading while emulated VRAM is inaccessible
- Several sound channels are doing very weird things
- Pausing in the frist level darkens colours permanently (until exiting stage)

#### From Link's Awakening

- Feather sound effect is... not right somehow

#### From Oracle of Ages & Oracle of Ages/Seasons

- Sprite colours not right
- Sound effects drawn out for MUCH too long

#### From Perfect Dark

- Shooting ranges lag noticeably
- Many sound effects missing (running footsteps, gunshots, guards taking damage)
- Sprite visibility very inconsistent (2-tile-wide column on left-hand-side blocks all sprites)
- Skipping Rare logo animation leads to corrupt graphic (and the corruption is not consistent)
- Loading a save after progressing some way into training seems to crash

#### Wario Land 3

- Save games after reaching a certain amount of progress do not load
- First level - Wario and spear dudes are invisible behind grass
